# **A**nimal's **B**asic Notepad app.

Does what it says on the tin, a simple web-based note taking application with the ability to 'save' your notes as a URL which can be later restored by visiting that URL.

Currently notes are just a title and `textarea`, I may try to add a list variant, but no promises.
